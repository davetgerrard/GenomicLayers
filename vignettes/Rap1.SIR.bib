	abstract = {A molecular model for the formation of yeast core telomeric heterochromatin has been proposed recently. The RAP1 protein provides the specificity for the localization of heterochromatin through its recognition of telomeric DNA sequences. Its complexing with silencing information regulators (SIR2, SIR3 and SIR4) and histones H3 and H4 generates a folded-back DNA structure. This not only represses adjacent genes through SIR-protein—histone interactions, but also enables condensation and protection of the telomeric end. The SIR2 and SIR4 levels at the core differ from those in the extended telomeric heterochromatin produced when the limiting protein, SIR3, is overexpressed.},

	abstract = {Rap1p binds to sites embedded within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomeric TG1-3 tract. Previous studies have led to the hypothesis that Rap1p may recruit Sir3p and Sir3p-associating factors to the telomere. To test this, we tethered Sir3p adjacent to the telomere via LexA binding sites in the rap1-17 mutant that truncates the Rap1p C-terminal 165 amino acids thought to contain sites for Sir3p association. Tethering of LexA-Sir3p adjacent to the telomere is sufficient to restore telomeric silencing, indicating that Sir3p can nucleate silencing at the telomere. Tethering of LexA-Sir3p or the LexA-Sir3p(N2O5) gain-of-function protein to a telomeric LexA site hyperrepresses an adjacent ADE2 gene in wild-type cells. Hence, Sir3p recruitment to the telomere is limiting in telomeric silencing. In addition, LexA-Sir3p(N2O5) hyperrepresses telomeric silencing when tethered to a subtelomeric site 3.6 kb from the telomeric tract. This hyperrepression is dependent on the C terminus of Rap1p, suggesting that subtelomeric LexA-Sir3p(N205) can interact with Rap1p-associated factors at the telomere. We also demonstrate that LexA-Sir3p or LexA-Sir3p(N205) tethered in cis with a short tract of telomeric TG1-3 sequences is sufficient to confer silencing at an internal chromosomal position. Internal silencing is enhanced in rap1-17 strains. We propose that sequestration of silencing factors at the telomere limits the efficiency of internal silencing.},

	abstract = {The organization of eukaryotic genomes is characterized by the presence of distinct euchromatic and heterochromatic sub-nuclear compartments. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterochromatic loci, including telomeres and silent mating type loci, form clusters at the nuclear periphery. We have employed live cell 3-D imaging and chromosome conformation capture (3C) to determine the contribution of nuclear positioning and heterochromatic factors in mediating associations of the silent mating type loci. We identify specific long-range interactions between HML and HMR that are dependent upon silencing proteins Sir2p, Sir3p, and Sir4p as well as Sir1p and Esc2p, two proteins involved in establishment of silencing. Although clustering of these loci frequently occurs near the nuclear periphery, colocalization can occur equally at more internal positions and is not affected in strains deleted for membrane anchoring proteins yKu70p and Esc1p. In addition, appropriate nucleosome assembly plays a role, as deletion of ASF1 or combined disruption of the CAF-1 and HIR complexes abolishes the HML-HMR interaction. Further, silencer proteins are required for clustering, but complete loss of clustering in asf1 and esc2 mutants had only minor effects on silencing. Our results indicate that formation of heterochromatic clusters depends on correctly assembled heterochromatin at the silent loci and, in addition, identify an Asf1p-, Esc2p-, and Sir1p-dependent step in heterochromatin formation that is not essential for gene silencing but is required for long-range interactions.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract Genomes are organized into active regions known as euchromatin and inactive regions known as heterochromatin, or silenced chromatin. This review describes contemporary knowledge and models for how silenced chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae forms, functions, and is inherited. In S. cerevisiae, Sir proteins are the key structural components of silenced chromatin. Sir proteins interact first with silencers, which dictate which regions are silenced, and then with histone tails in nucleosomes as the Sir proteins spread from silencers along chromosomes. Importantly, the spreading of silenced chromatin requires the histone deacetylase activity of Sir2p. This requirement leads to a general model for the spreading and inheritance of silenced chromatin or other special chromatin states. Such chromatin domains are marked by modifications of the nucleosomes or DNA, and this mark is able to recruit an enzyme that makes further marks. Thus, among different organisms, multiple forms of repressive chromatin can be formed using similar strategies but completely different proteins. We also describe emerging evidence that mutations that cause global changes in the modification of histones can alter the balance between euchromatin and silenced chromatin within a cell.},

	abstract = {In budding yeast, the Sir2, Sir3 and Sir4 proteins form SIR complexes, required for the assembly of silent heterochromatin domains, and which mediate transcription silencing at the telomeres as well as at silent mating type loci. In this study, under fluorescence microscopy, we found most Sir3-GFP expressions in the logarithmic phase cells appeared as multiple punctations as expected. However, some differences in the distribution of fluorescent signals were detected in the diauxic{\textasciitilde}early stationary phase cells. To clarify these, we then used ChIP on chip assays to investigate the genome-wide localization of Sir3. In general, Sir3 binds to all 32 telomere proximal regions, the silent mating type loci and also binds to the rDNA region. However, the genome-wide localization patterns of Sir3 are different between these two distinct growth phases. We also confirmed that Sir3 binds to a recently identified secondary binding site, PAU genes, and further identified 349 Sir3-associated cluster regions. These results provide additional support in roles for Sir3 in the modulation of gene expression during physical conditions such as diauxic{\textasciitilde}early stationary phase growing. Moreover, they imply that Sir3 may be not only involved in the formation of conventional silent heterochromatin, but also able to associate with some other chromatin regions involved in epigenetic regulation.},

	abstract = {A wide divergence has been detected in the telomeric sequences among budding yeast species. Despite their length and homogeneity differences, all these yeast telomeric sequences show a conserved core which closely matches the consensus RAP1-binding sequence. We demonstrate that the RAP1 protein binds this sequence core, without involving the diverged sequences outside the core. In Saccharomyces castellii and Saccharomyces dairensis specific classes of interspersed variant repeats are present. We show here that a RAP1-binding site is formed in these species by connecting two consecutive 8 bp telomeric repeats. DNase I footprint analyses specify the binding site as the 13 bp sequence CTGGGTGTCTGGG. The RAP1 protein also binds the variant repeats, although with a lowered affinity. However, a split footprint is produced when RAP1 binds a variant repeat where the two half-sites of the binding site are separated by an additional 6 nt. This is probably caused by the intervening sequence looping out of the RAP1–DNA complex. We suggest that the bipartite subdomain structure of the RAP1 protein allows it to remodel telomeric chromatin, a feature which may be of great relevance for telomeric chromatin assembly and structure in vivo.},
