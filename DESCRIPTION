Description: Simulate changes to epigenetic states informed by genomic sequence.
    Predict transcription (or any positional mark) from genome sequence by modelling
    the __factors__ that can bind to DNA and add or remove states. The raw DNA
    sequence cannot be altered but a series of __layers__ (binary vectors of same
    length of sequence) can have regions of any length switched (0 <-> 1). Some
    factors may also recognise patterns on the layers (e.g. regions in state 1)
    in addition to or instead of the underlying DNA sequence. The system models
    a series of very many sequential binding and modifying events. The ability of
    factors to bind changes through this series so that the number and positions of
    possible binding events for each factor change during the sequence.
